  <h6 id="1">1. Introduction</h6>
  <p>
    This tutorial is a slightly modified copy of
    <a href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/web/tutorial/tutorial-2.pdf">this one</a>
    from the <i>Coot</i> website.
    It assumes you are familiar with the concepts covered in
    <a href="part1.html">part 1</a> of the workshop.
  </p>
  <p>
    When automatic building fails,
    typically because the resolution limit of your data is too low,
    then building the molecule "by hand" may be the only way to proceed.
    Recognizing the shape of main-chain and side-chain densities is valuable
    and this tutorial aims to introduce these to you.
    Note that this tutorial map is an easy map to build into,
    the side chains are (mostly) clear.
    Using just a map and a sequence, we will attempt to generate a model.
    This model can then be validated and refined with Refmac for several rounds.
    With some experience you should be able to get
    an R-factor of less than 20% in less than 30 minutes.
  </p>

  <h6 id="2">2. Starting</h6>
  <p>
    Open <code>Coot</code>, then click
    <code>Extensions / Load tutorial model and data</code>
    to load the structure.
    It has two chains with 96 residues in each.
    Start by going to the C-alpha of residue 2 in the A chain.
    The idea is to build the complete A chain in the forward direction
    and compare it to the real structure afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make a note of the position of the C-alpha in residue 1 then
    hide the molecule in the <code>Display Manager</code>
    until you have finished building, validating and refining.
    It is also a good idea to hide the difference map
    because we are not interested in the previously built model.
  </p>
  <p>
    The backbone trace through the density
    can be more easily visualised
    by using a skeleton map.
    Go to <code>Calculate / Map Skeleton</code>
    and change it to <code>On</code>.
  </p>

  <h6 id="3">3. Baton Building</h6>
  <p>
    We will now start to “baton build” the map.
    Go to <code>Calculate / Other Modelling Tools</code> to open another toolbar
    and click <code>C-alpha Baton Mode</code>.
    A set of controls will appear,
    as well as a white baton
    and a set of pink points that show possible places for a C-alpha
    that are 3.8 &angst; away from the current position.
  </p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="one-half column"><img src="img/baton_view.png" alt="Baton View"></div>
    <div class="one-half column"><img src="img/baton_controls.png" alt="Baton Controls"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Remember, when you start, you are placing a CA at the baton tip
    for residue 1 (the N-terminus).
    After placing CA for residue 1,
    you will get a choice of positions for residue 2,
    which is currently at the centre of the view.
    This might seem that you are "double-backing" on yourself
    - which can be confusing the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Press <code>Try Another</code> and <code>Previous Tip Position</code>
    to cycle through the points,
    <code>Lengthen</code> and <code>Shorten</code> to change the baton length,
    and <code>Accept</code> to place a CA and move onto the next residue.
    If none of the probe points are suitable
    you can use <code>b</code> to toggle baton swivel mode.
    If you have installed the template keybindings
    (through <code>Extensions / Settings</code>)
    then you can use the shortcut
    <code>A</code> (<code>Shift</code><code>a</code>)
    to accept the baton position.
  </p>
  <p>
    Build from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.
    There are 96 residues to build and it takes about 15 minutes or so.
    If you make a mistake you can press <code>Undo</code>
    to move back one residue.
    The last residue should be a cysteine that forms a disulphide bond.
    Click <code>Dismiss</code> on the baton controls when done.
    There may also be a molecule called <code>Baton Atom Guide Points</code>
    that needs deleting.
    You can probably also turn the map skeleton off at this stage.
  </p>

  <h6 id="4">4. Convert to Mainchain</h6>
  <p>
    Now we need to turn these CA positions into mainchain.
    Use <code>Go To Atom</code> to centre on the first residue
    of the <code>Baton Atoms</code> molecule.
    Then use <code>Ca Zone -> Mainchain</code>
    in <code>Other Modelling Tools</code>
    and click on the first CA.
    You will need to wait several seconds while it builds
    (note that you need at least 6 baton points for this to work).
    Two new molecules will be created:
    <code>mainchain-forwards</code> and <code>mainchain-backwards</code>
    traced in different directions.
    We know the forward direction is correct
    (see how much better the carbonyls fit)
    so the other molecule can be deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The backbone now needs to be tidied up.
    Go to <code>Extensions / All Molecule / Stepped Refine</code>,
    pick <code>mainchain-forwards</code>
    and watch it as it goes.
    Is it making mistakes?
    That refinement may have gone to quickly to make a note of problem areas.
    Use <code>Density fit analysis</code>
    and real space refinement to correct anything that's wrong.
  </p>

  <h6 id="5">5. Assign Sequence</h6>
  <p>
    Let’s tell Coot that we have a sequence associated with this set of CA points. So,Extensions→Dock Sequence→Assign SequenceTurn on auto-fit of residuesSo when the file is assigned “Assign Closest fragment”.[Coot thinks for a several seconds while assigning sidechains, then goes aboutmutating and fitting the residues
    What’s that you say? Coot didn’t do that? Well, that’s becauseyou mainchainmodel is too bad for Coot to recognize the sidechain positions. You need to reviewyou mainchain model and make sure sure that the CBs are in density and pointing
    in the right direction. When you have improved you model sufficiently well, Cootwill apply the sequence to it using the above method.Change the Chain ID from “ “ to “A”.
  </p>

  <h6 id="6">6. Build Another Molecule</h6>
  <p>
    Now we need to build another molecule (the NCS related copy).So using themap skeleton search around to find a volume of density not already build (and notsymmetry related to the model already built).Here’s a hint, find the a helix in the skeleton.•Using the Other Modelling Tools, place a helix over the skeleton points of theskeleton.•Improve the fit of the skeleton, taking note that the N and C terminus of thehelix are well-fitted.•Associate the same sequence with the new Helix molecule•Dock sidechains on the new molecule (it should work if your helix is good)•Now compare the Helix molecule with the previously built model.  Findmatching start and end point on the helix and previous model.•LSQ fit a copy of the previous model on top of the Helix molecule[Coot displayes a new molecule that almost fits the so-far unbuilt density.]Let’s call this new chain, chain “B”•Now clean up the fit, first do a rigid body refinement of the wholenewmodel. . .•then an All Molecule stepped refine should make the fit nice
    Merge the “B” chain into the “A” chain molecule above:Calculate→Merge molecules→Append/Insert Molecule(s)[Choose the mostrecent mainchain molecule]into Molecule[Choose the molecule of the A chain]→Merge.
    Unfortunately, there is no slick way to make Coot rebuild ghosts for this compositemolecule. We need to write out the pdb file and read it in again -inelegant.File→Save Coordinates,[Choose the molecule that does now contains boththe A and B chains]→Select Filename. . .Pick a filename then useFile→OpenCoordinates. . .to read it in again.Check the console as you do this, Coot will tell you that thereare NCS relatedmolecules. If12it does this, we’re in business.In the following, you will need to know the first and last residue numbers inthe “A” chain. Use the Go To Atom dialog to find them.If ghosts appear, use:Extensions→NCS. . .→Copy NCS Residue Range. . .using “A”13as the Mas-ter Chain ID then fill in the first and last residue numbers of theA chain.[Coot builds the B chain as an NCS copy of the A chain
  </p>

  <h6 id="7">7. Finishing Touches</h6>
  <p>
      Use NCS jumping (the ’O’ key) to see NCS differences.Now unmodelled blobs - like we did before.Find the ligand (3GP), merge it in.Refine using Refmac.Validate.Rebuild
